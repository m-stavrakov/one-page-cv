        <h3>About me</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Martin Stavrakov is a forensic science graduate who is extremely passionate to learn new skills. Currently he is working as a 
            laboratory technician, however in the meantime he is studying to become a full stack software developer. He enrolled in an amazing
            Full stack software development course at UCD. In this course I will learn many new skills such as creating and designing web pages as well as adding functionality using JS. 
            In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends going out, visiting new places, and playing board games. I enjoy reading in my free time and my favorite genre is murder mysteries.
